# GeometricShapeModellingUsingObjectOrientedProgrammingConcepts
This assignment is done as part of the course "Advanced Programming in C++". In this assignment by using geometric shapes, I have worked in depth with the fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), namely, the concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, and polymorphism.
